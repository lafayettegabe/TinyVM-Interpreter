TinyVM-Interpreter is a lightweight virtual machine interpreter implemented in C++. It's a simple implementation designed for understanding the fundamentals of virtual machines and instruction execution. I created this project for my Systems Programming Class as a hands-on way to explore system-level concepts.

## Features
- Load and execute programs from memory
- Basic arithmetic and control flow instructions
- Simple debugging interface
